# Advent of Code 2020

Heard about this on [CodingBlocks podcast](https://www.codingblocks.net/) and thought I'd give it a try.

Since it's interview-esque puzzles that probably involve using data structures correctly, it would probably be best to do them in C/C++, get that low-level implementation.

But I don't want to do that. I want to try a new language, and Kotlin seems like a better Java.

Having collection libraries rather than writing my own simplifies things quite a bit, but I think the benefit of just trying the challenges is still there.

Plus I got to put Design Patterns to use!
